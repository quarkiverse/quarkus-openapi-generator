= Quarkus - OpenAPI Generator
:extension-status: preview

This a multipurpose Quarkus' extension for generation of https://quarkus.io/guides/rest-client[Rest Clients] and xref:server.adoc[Server stubs] based on OpenAPI specification files.

Currently, we support two types of code generation:

Quarkus - OpenAPI Generator - Client: xref:client.adoc[Refer to our documentation] on how to generate these clients.

Quarkus - OpenAPI Generator - Server: xref:server.adoc[Follow our guidelines] to generate server stubs using Apicurio.

WARNING: Check versions 1.x.x if you're still using Quarkus 2. But be aware that we no longer support Quarkus 2. That means there are no updates planned for those versions.

This extension is based on the https://openapi-generator.tech/[OpenAPI Generator Tool]. Please consider donation to help them maintain the
