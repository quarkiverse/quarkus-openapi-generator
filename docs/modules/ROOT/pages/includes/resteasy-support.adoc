You can use the `quarkus-openapi-generator` with REST Client Classic or REST Client Reactive respectively. To do so add either the classic or reactive jackson dependency to your project's `pom.xml` file:

== RESTEasy Classic

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-rest-client-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

WARNING: After Version 1.2.1 / 2.1.1 you need to declare the above dependency explicitly! Even if you stay with the REST Client Classic implementation!

== RESTEasy Reactive

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-rest-client-reactive-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

To make truly non-blocking calls, you need to also set the `mutiny` option to `true`. This
will wrap all API return types in a `io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni`.

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.mutiny=true

=== Configuring Return Types for Specific Operations

In cases where you need more granular control over the return types of specific OpenAPI operations, you can configure individual operations to return either a `Uni` or a `Multi`. By default, when `mutiny=true` is enabled, all API methods will return a `Uni`. However, if you have operations that should return multiple items reactively, you can specify either `Multi` or `Uni` for those operations.

To achieve this, use the `mutiny.operation-ids` configuration to set the return type for each operation by its `operationId` as defined in the OpenAPI specification.

For example:

[source,properties]
----
# Enable Mutiny support for all operations
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.mutiny=true

# Configure return type for specific operation IDs
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.mutiny.operation-ids.addPet=Uni
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.mutiny.operation-ids.updatePet=Multi
----

In this example:

* The `addPet` operation will return a `Uni`.
* The `updatePet` operation will return a `Multi`.

This allows fine-grained control over which operations are expected to return a single result (`Uni`) and which should handle streams of results (`Multi`).

WARNING: If an incorrect or unsupported return type is specified for an `mutiny.operation-ids`, the generator will fallback to returning a `Uni` by default. Ensure that the return type for each operation is either `Uni` or `Multi` to avoid unintended behavior.

When using RESTEasy Reactive:

* The client must not declare multiple MIME-TYPES with `@Consumes`
* You might need to implement a `ParamConverter` for each complex type
