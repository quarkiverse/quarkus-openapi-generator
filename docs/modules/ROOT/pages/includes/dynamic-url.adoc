If you need the generated `RestClient` to target different server URLs at runtime—rather than relying solely on the static URL from the application configuration—you can enable dynamic base URL support.

To do so, set the following property in your configuration:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.use-dynamic-url=true
----

When this property is enabled and `quarkus-rest-client` is present on the classpath, the generator will include a method parameter annotated with `@io.quarkus.rest.client.reactive.Url`. This allows your application to supply the target URL dynamically at runtime.

This feature is particularly useful when integrating with multiple instances of the same API or switching endpoints based on contextual information.

For more details, refer to the official Quarkus documentation:
