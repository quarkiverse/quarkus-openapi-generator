In the default configuration, the generated RestClient is designed to set container types (e.g., lists, maps, or other collections) to null when no data is provided by the API.

However, if you prefer container types to default to empty values instead (e.g., an empty list or map), you can override the default behavior by setting the following property in your configuration:

[source,properties]
quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.spec.my_openapi_yaml.initialize-empty-collections=true

When this property is set to true, the generator will ensure that container types are initialized with empty values instead of null, allowing you to avoid null-checks and directly work with populated collections.
This feature is particularly useful when you expect the generated code to follow a defensive programming approach, or when dealing with APIs that always expect empty containers instead of null values.
